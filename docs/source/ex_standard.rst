================================
Standard example
================================

.. testsetup::
    import effluent
    from pathlib import Path

In this example we show how to generate some code. We start with the following:

.. doctest::

    >>> print(Path(effluent.__file__).name)
    __init__.py

As we can see, the end result is as expected..
