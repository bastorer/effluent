# Properties of the pipe and the effluent flow
#
#  time: Time since simulation start [s]
#  flow: Pipe flow rate [m^3/s]
#  dens: Mass density of effluent wastewater [kg/m^3]
#  diam: Pipe diameter [m]
#  depth: Depth of pipe outlet [m]
#  decline: Direction of pipe outlet (positive is downwards) [degrees]
